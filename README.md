## Drawbacks
1. The Login System is just like an open garden with a door in between for no reason and thus there was no need for it since it's not serving any purpose
2. The UI of this web-app is not mobile compatible as in it's really messy
3. Most pages in beginner's lessons have bootstrap used in them , so the UI is slightly off
4. The test is static i.e It has 5 questions only
5. Low Level of Error Handling
6. No Authentication for the link/API
